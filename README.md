# COMP-348-Assignments
Assignments done in C, Python, Clojure and Erlang

## Assignment 1 - C
In this assignment you write a program called mathpipe that performs simple operations
on some input numbers. The program reads a jagged-array1 from the standard input and
applies the requested operation on each row and prints the result to the standard output.
Upon processing a row, the output will be printed to the standard output. In case of any
processing error, the error message is reported to the stderr followed by the immediate
abnormal termination of the program. In case of no error, the program successfully ter-
minates.

## Assignment 2 - Python
In this assignment you implement an interactive python application that reads and processes
some databases of shapes in text format. Supported shapes are: Shape (the generic shape
object), Circle, Ellipse, and Rhombus.

## Assignment 3 - Clojure
Simple query management system with the text files provided
